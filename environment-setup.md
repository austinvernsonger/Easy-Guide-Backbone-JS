# Environment Setup

Backbone.js is very easy to setup and work. This chapter will discuss about download and setup of Backbone.js library. Backbone.js can be used in two ways:

* Downloading UI library from its official website.

* Downloading UI library from CDNs


## Downloading UI library from its official website

When you open the link [http://backbonejs.org/](http://backbonejs.org/), you will get to see a screen as below:

As you can see, there are three options for download of this library:

* Development Version - Right click on this button and save as and you get full source JavaScript library.

* Production Version - Right click on this button and save as and you get Backbone-min.js library file which is packed and gzipped.

* Edge Version - Right click on this button and save as and you get an unreleased version i.e development is going on, hence you need to use it at your own risk.


### Dependencies

Backbonejs depends on the following javascript files:

* Underscore.js : This is the only hard dependency which needs to be included. You can get it from here

* jQuery.js : Include this file for RESTful persistence, history support via Backbone.Router and DOM manipulation with Backbone.View. You can get it from here


* json2.js : Include this file for older Internet Explorer support. You can get it from here
